## About Me

I'm a *self-taught Front-End Developer* from *Sydney, Australia* who just absolutely LOVES to fix bugs. I just love that level of satisfaction you recieve after spending countless hours tinkering on a bug and finally getting it to work. 

I'd say my desire to learn web development stems from my curious and creative nature. It was through online tutorials and countless hours of self study that I was able to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. As I delved deeper into the intricacies of front-end development, I discovered the endless possibilities that come with creating seamless and intuitive user experiences.
