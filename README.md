## About Me

I'm a *self-taught Front-End Developer* from *Sydney, Australia* with a passion for crafting user-friendly and visually captivating websites. With a focus on clean code and continuous learning, I enjoy translating design concepts into visually appealing and functional digital experiences.

Armed with a *Bachelor's degree in Medical Science from UTS*, I ventured into the exciting world of IT, where I discovered my true calling as a Frontend Software Engineer. With each line of code, I strive to create elegant solutions that merge form and function, leaving a lasting impression on those who interact with them. I'm currently on a self-study mission to reach the pinnacle of dev greatness, or at least be the best in Australia... no big deal! 💪

I've got a keen eye for design and a love for experimenting with colours, which is why I find styling UI (especially responsive design) to be one of my favourite parts of the job. So let's build something beautiful together and make the internet a better place (or at least make it look pretty). 🎨🖌

- 👩🏽‍💻 *Looking for opportunities!*
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *React.js*
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the rare breed who *loves CSS*

## My Skill-set

- *Language: I'm proficient in **JavaScript*, and I'm always excited to learn and explore new programming languages.

- *Frontend Development: I have a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm well-versed in frontend frameworks and libraries, with **React* being my primary expertise. I love building interactive and dynamic web applications using React's component-based architecture.
